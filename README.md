# Try-Catch Practice
This practice demonstrates a basic implementation of the try-catch mechanism in C#. The program:

Prompts the user to enter a number.
Calculates and displays the square of the entered number.
Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric values) and displays an appropriate error message.
Continues to prompt the user until a valid number is entered.

## Features:

Validates user input to ensure it's a number.
Provides error messages for invalid inputs and unexpected errors.

## Technologies Used:
C#: A modern, object-oriented programming language.
.NET: A framework for building and running applications on Windows.
